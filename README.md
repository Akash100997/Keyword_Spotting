# Keyword Spotting

In this project, we have used Google Speech Commands Dataset to Create a Keyword Spotting Program.
All the Data's in the Dataset have been preprocessed. That is their MFCC Features are extracted and stored in a numpy file. 
The Numpy file is then loaded and I have used the Keras API (tensorflow) to Build, Compile and Train the model.

Inference has been done with the data's that were not used for training.
